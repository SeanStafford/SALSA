SALSA - Substitution, Approximation, evoLutionary Search, and Ab-initio

A high-throughput computational materials discovery pipeline for identifying
materials with target properties.

The workflow combines:
- Ionic substitution from known compounds (ICSD database)
- Property interpolation for candidate filtering
- USPEX evolutionary crystal structure prediction
- CRYSTAL DFT calculations for electronic properties
